# occhio
_/ˈɔk.kjo/ — like Tokyo_

A toy library for playing with Toy Models of Superposition.

Named for the Italian word for "eye" — because we're trying to see what's hiding in those hidden dimensions — and for a certain wooden boy who wanted to be real, because these are, after all, toy models dreaming of becoming interpretable.
